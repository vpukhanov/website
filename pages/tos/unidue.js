        </p>
        <p className='text-body'>
          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties,
          so the above exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions do not

          indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive
          damages arising from or relating to these terms or your use of, or
          incapability to use the App even if the Developer has been advised of
          the possibility of such damages. Access to and use of the App is at
          your own discretion and risk, and you will be solely responsible for

          arising from or related to this agreement, will at all times be
          limited to a maximum of fifty U.S. dollars (u.s. $50). The existence

          Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of
          liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above
